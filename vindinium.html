    <p>
     Vindinium is a multi-player turn based dungeon crawling game.
    </p>
    <p>
     Each player has one hero that can move across a map.
    </p>
    <p>
    The objective is for players to amass the maximum quantity of gold during a predetermined number of turns. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Players must take control of gold mines to produce gold; however, gold mines are protected by goblins.
    </p>
    <p>
    When a player defeats a goblin, he becomes owner of the gold mine and receives one gold per turn.
    </p>
    <p>
    Furthermore, the goblin now defends the mine against other players.
